# CapstoneProject2021
This repo contains the code, data dictionary, and report submitted for my data science master's capstone project from March 2021.

The reviewing professor, A. Banasiewicz comments were:
As a general rule, there is an inverse correlation between the quality of work and the volume of my comments, which means that my comments are going to be relatively brief here as the quality of your work is good. Well approached, clearly described, and well substantiated, including good use of thoughtful visualizations; I have to say I was quite pleased with what your report's contents and the overall looks and feel. You earned an A on your capstone project.

Congratulations, keep up the good work, and best of luck in your endeavors.
