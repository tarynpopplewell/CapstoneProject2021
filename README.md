# CapstoneProject2021
This repo contains the code, data dictionary, and report submitted for my data science master's capstone project from March 2021.

The reviewing professor, A. Banasiewicz comments were:

As a general rule, there is an inverse correlation between the quality of work and the volume of my comments, which means that my comments are going to be relatively brief here as the quality of your work is good. Well approached, clearly described, and well substantiated, including good use of thoughtful visualizations; I have to say I was quite pleased with what your report's contents and the overall looks and feel. You earned an A on your capstone project.

Congratulations, keep up the good work, and best of luck in your endeavors. 


The assignment required a likelihood and severity estimate of an investor class action lawsuit for a randomly assigned company. I was assigned Mohawk Industries. When I was finished with my model I looked up Mohawk and learned that as of July 2020 it was embroiled in some <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/07/14/2061771/0/en/NYSE-MHK-Investor-Notice-Update-in-Lawsuit-against-Mohawk-Industries-Inc-announced-by-Shareholders-Foundation.html">investor litigation</a>, so that's validating! 

<b>Appendix A</b> is just a spreadsheet of all the fields used from the 4 original data files. I used this to stay organized and keep an eye on which file I used a given field from as there were duplicates across the original data source files.

<b>Appendix B</b> is a text file of all the code used to cleanse the data and build the model. I have uploaded these as three individual R files; one for the primary data cleansing, one for the qualitative analysis (likelihood estimate), and one for the quantitative analysis (severity estimate).
